I noticed that the turn_off_ssl_verification option was no longer working in the latest version. I tracked the bug down with the switch to cURL. Under the hood it was directly using the value of turn_off_ssl_verification to set the cURL flag CURLOPT_SSL_VERIFYPEER but they actually have the opposite boolean meaning.

CURLOPT_SSL_VERIFYPEER

FALSE to stop cURL from verifying the peer's certificate. Alternate certificates to verify against can be specified with the CURLOPT_CAINFO option or a certificate directory can be specified with the CURLOPT_CAPATH option.
